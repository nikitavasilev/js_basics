/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3.
(Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

var johnHeight, johnMass, markHeight, markMass;
johnHeight = 180;
johnMass = 80;
markHeight = 176;
markMass = 69;

var johnBmi, markBmi;
johnBmi = johnMass / (johnHeight ** 2);
markBmi = markMass / (markHeight ** 2);

console.log('John\'s BMI is ' + johnBmi + '. And Mark\'s is ' + markBmi + '.');

isMarkHigher = markBmi > johnBmi;
console.log('Is Mark\'s BMI higher than John\'s? ' + isMarkHigher);

// SOLUTION

var massMark = 78; // kg
var heightMark = 1.69; // meters

var massJohn = 92;
var heightJohn = 1.95;

var BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
var BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

var markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;
console.log('Is Mark\'s BMI higher than John\'s? ' + markHigherBMI);
